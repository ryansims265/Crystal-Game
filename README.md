This is the unit 4 game, homework assignment using JQuery. 

It is a game similar to blackjack in that the user is trying to get their score to match the score of the house, or the computer. 

However, unsimilar to blackjack, the number that the user is trying to get changes every round. 

The computer randomly chooses a score at the beggning of each round that the user is trying to get to. 

The user score always starts at 0. 

Ther user is presented with 4 pictures all of which have a different value. 

Each time the user clicks a picture, their score is increased the value associated with the picture. 

If the user gets their score to match the value of the computers then they win. 

If the user allows their score to go over the computer value then they lose. 

If the user wins then 1 win is added to the scoreboard.

If the user loses then 1 loss is added to the scoreboard. 

The value of the pictures also changes every round so they player is unable to figure out the value of each and retain it in each game. 

Happy playing!
